        <h3>Game Instructions</h3>
        <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Manage an IPL team and bid for players to create the best squad within a set budget.</p>
        
        <h4>Squad Requirements</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Minimum squad size: 18 players</li>
            <li>Maximum squad size: 24 players</li>
<li>Maximum Foreign size: 8 players</li>
            <li>Roles needed per team:
                <ul>
                    <li>Batsmen (BAT): At least 7</li>
                    <li>Bowlers (BOWL): At least 7</li>
                    <li>Wicketkeepers (WK): At least 3</li>
                    <li>All-rounders (AR): At least 5</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Bidding Rules</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Each player has a base price, which is the starting bid.</li>
            <li>The auction lasts for 30 seconds per player. If no bids are made within this time, the player remains unsold.</li>
            <li>Click the "Bid" button to place a bid on a player. Each bid increases the price by â‚¹1 million.</li>
            <li>Teams compete automatically against your bids. If another team bids higher, the player goes to that team.</li>
            <li>If your team has the highest bid after 30 seconds, the player is sold to your team and the amount is deducted from your budget.</li>
            <li>Unsold players will be marked in red, and sold players in green.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>How to Play</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Select your team and start the auction by clicking "Next Player".</li>
            <li>Click "Bid" to place bids. Make sure you have enough budget for each bid.</li>
            <li>Try to build a balanced squad that meets the squad requirements.</li>
            <li>Once all players are auctioned, the game ends, and you can view your final team lineup.</li>
